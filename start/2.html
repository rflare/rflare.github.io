        Later, that day, you check your voicemail.<br>
        It says “Due to insufficient taxes paid, your house will be forfeited to the government, and you will be evicted from your home.”<br>
        “What?!” you said. “I paid for everything! This can’t be real!”<br>
        Is it from the bank? Something is wrong.
