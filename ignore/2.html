        <p>
        The next day you get the same call but with an irritated tone: <br>
        “Due to insufficient taxes paid, your house will be forfeited to the government,
        and you will be evicted from your home.”<br>
        Knowing it's wrong, you decide to enjoy the weekend,
        but as the night sets, your doorbell goes off.
