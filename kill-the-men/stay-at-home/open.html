        [“THATS IT IM KILLING THEM NOW”]
        You think to yourself. <br> 
	    You burst the door open, incredibly tensed up.
        Nothing else exists except the need to kill.<br>
        However, the one second it took for you to open the door was enough
        time for the men to react and see the knife in your hand.<br><br>
        You get folded like an omelette.
