        “AHHHHHHHH” <br>
        You’re way way way too stressed. <br>
        Your heart beats strong like thunder, fast as rain.
        You’re not even driving consciously anymore.
        Every turn you make is by instinct.<br>
        Then, you catch a glimpse of a hoard of cars, piled up in one place.<br>
        It was a red light, and then red blood.
