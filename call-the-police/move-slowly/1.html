        <p>
        You breathe slowly. No one can hear you anyway. <br/>
        You could probably think more rationally<br/>
        “Hey, I could probably hide better under my bed.”<br/>
        You try to move slowly. Each step is as silent as a bug.<br/>
        Now you just have to slowly open the door, then crawl under your bed.
