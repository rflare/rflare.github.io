        <p>
        You breathe slowly. No one can hear you anyway. 
        You could probably think more rationally
        “Hey, I could probably hide better under my bed.”
        You try to move slowly. Each step is as silent as a bug.
        Now you just have to slowly open the door, then crawl under your bed.
