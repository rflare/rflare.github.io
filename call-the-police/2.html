        You dialed 9-1-1
        “Hello, this is 911. What's your emergency?”
        “Hey two weird men are barging into my door trying to kill me”
        “Alright, we’re going to send a few officers to help you, don’t go anywhere, ok?”
        You hear a crash downstairs.
        The tall one is saying something: “Hey, I think I heard some noise. Let’s look around”
        Crap. They heard your call.
