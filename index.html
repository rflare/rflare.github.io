        After a long week of work, you’re paid your salary of 2945.6 dollars before tax, a considerable chunk of change. After buying groceries, paying off your loans, you’re left with 500 dollars. Later, that day, you check your voicemail. It says “Due to insufficient taxes paid, your house will be forfeited to the government, and you will be evicted from your home.”
        “What?!” you said. “I paid for everything! This can’t be real!”
        Is it from the bank? Something is wrong.
